# Music Photographers Group Rules

## Respect each other

I firmly believe in the Tolerance Paradox, where to mantain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.
Said that, I don't care if you are the best photographer in the world or you just started out and you still need to understand the difference between Tv and Av, but in this group I demand that everyone treat each other in a respectful matter. It's okay to discuss, we all have different opinions, but just plain insults are not acceptable.

## No Spam

Let's put it in this way: if you go to a plumber convention, surrounded by plumbers, would you go there and scream "Hey I do plumbing jobs, come to me I'll fix your sink!"? I would feel rather silly to do something like that. So there's no point to come to the group to beg for likes on your facebook/instagram/twitter accounts, it's pointless and it doesn't bring you any new clients.
So from now on:

- Don't spam your website unless your are asking for critics or you want to share something that you think it could be helpful for the community.
- Upload your photos directly to the group, not by sharing your facebook page or similar, you uploaded it once on it, you can do it twice.
- Do not overload the group with too many posts with a single photo in a day, create an album instead.

## Be ready for critics

The idea of the group is to help people improve their skills, so if you upload a photo, expect critics, if you don't like to be criticized, then don't post anything.
Discuss about a photo is fine, insult somebody because you don't like his photo it is not. Always be constructive and respectful to your peers.


## Try not to be a dick

So please don't do the following:
- Create pointless flames
- Insult people over race, religion, gender, etc...
- Bullying of any kind will not be tolerated
